Not surprising #Ferguson low info voters, who see strong arm robbery as shoplifting would think assaulting cops was playful wrestling #tcot
I&#39;d rather be attacked by a grizzly than a thug; when you drop a grizzly, the rest of the animals don&#39;t give FALSE testimony #Ferguson

@rosaflores Cleaned up/slowed audio version w/distance analysis:&#10;
.@CNN If Brown stop/turns @ 1st shot (3s), he has 3 more sec to re-approach Wilson (6s total).&#10;&#10;

Article: Ferguson divides us less than we imagine. 
Or we demand more. RT @BroderickGreer: . . .we will stop burying young, unarmed black men, when this cntry buries white supremacy. #Ferguson
@AndrewLuck23 Unfortunately, most young(er) ppl don&#39;t know a thing about the civil rights movement #Ferguson
Wanted 2 throttle her. RT @GenXMedia: Fox News guest: Was Michael Brown too large to be an ‘unarmed teen’? #Ferguson 
@aijazmoin @Farah_Gazan @Petapup1 Thanks! Did you happen to see a link to an article connecting #Gaza to #Ferguson?
@Carl_Dix @bdoulaoblongata I think there&#39;s a cover-up &amp; it the DOJ will discover it. Predict jail time for police criminals #Ferguson
I&#39;ll ask again: Will someone please tell me what the hashtag #tcot stands for? Also, what is #Ferguson_SEA? #Ferguson
@AndrewLuck23 I totally agree. I tried to get that idea across in the early days of the protests. No one got it. #Ferguson
AAAAARGH!!!!! Spare me from young, dumb, ignorant white boys! #GetAFuckingClue #ReadSomeHistory #StopYourRacistBullshit #Ferguson #MikeBrown
There are more black policemen in #Ferguson than Black Democrat Senators in Congress. @RevAl @attorneycrump playing blacks like a fiddle.
@MalengaTeacher @DavidNelsonNews Rock thowing thing went on here in US at #ferguson.
More blacks thrived under Reaganomics than under Obama&#39;s plan. @marklevinshow #Ferguson #VMAs #spreadpositivity
What do cops think?  #ferguson #mikebrownfuneral 
@civilrightsorg Give it up. There is no racial discrimination unless it&#39;s against whites. Your last  losing card was played in #ferguson.
@CMReaK @reval @attorneycrump There are 4 police officers. Call #ferguson PD &amp; ask Timothy Zoll.  None of the media bothered to fact check.
Black cop kills white man media hide race #Ferguson See how many black officers w/trained &amp; left 4 higher pay.

When racist cops murder black men the 1st thing whites want to do is take race out of it b/c it explains so much about #America.#Ferguson
No matter the plethora of evidence  against #DarrenWilson as long as he remains white he will have millions of supporters.#Ferguson@CNN
@JayCordova23 Long long time ago there were these ppl called Native Americans.....should I go on? #Ferguson
The #Emmys aren&#39;t racist they just don&#39;t think a non white is worthy of an award. Or very few. #Ferguson#Racism@CNN@msnbc
